## Development server

Compatible node versions are >=8.9.0 and <=11.10.0

Run `npm i` from your local project directory.

In case of node_modules errors, remove `node_modules` directory by using command `rm -rf ./node_modules`.

Also remove `package-lock.json` file by using command `rm -rf package-lock.json`.

Now install fresh `node_modules` again by using command `npm i`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
